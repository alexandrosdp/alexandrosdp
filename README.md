**`Computational Scientist`**

Welcome to my Github, my name is Alex. As a Computational Scientist, I work within the intersection of data science, mathematical modeling, and high-performance computing. I write efficient and scalable code for scientific applications that are complex and data intensive. I am currently specialising in the domain of Computational Finance, aspiring to write high performance code for in house quantatative financial analysis software.
